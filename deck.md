## Modular Electronics for Earth and Beyond

# Slide 1: The Hook

> "The ability to perform in-situ repair of electronics at the component level can **dramatically reduce mission risk** and increase crew independence."
> — NASA, Component-Level Electronic Assembly Repair (CLEAR) Project

**What if the same technology NASA needs for Mars... is exactly what Earth needs right now?**

---

# Slide 2: The Problem

## We've built a disposable electronics economy

- **62 million tonnes** of e-waste generated annually (growing 5x faster than recycling)
- Only **22%** is properly recycled — declining to 20% by 2030
- **$62B** in recoverable materials lost every year
- **1 in 3** replaced devices still works when discarded

**The average appliance lifespan dropped from 14 years → under 4 years in two decades.**

---

# Slide 3: Why This Matters Beyond Earth

## Modularity isn't a feature. It's survival infrastructure.

**For a Mars mission:**

- Launch windows: every **26 months**
- Transit time: **6-9 months** each way
- Cost to ship 1kg to Mars: **$100,000+**
- You can't Amazon Prime a replacement microwave.

**NASA's conclusion:** Component-level repairability is the only viable path for long-duration missions.

**Our thesis:** What's essential for space is transformative for Earth.

# Slide 4: The Solution

## TECHNOLOGIC

A modular electronics platform where every component is:

- **Swappable** — upgrade or replace individual parts
- **Repairable** — fix what's broken, not the whole device
- **Upgradeable** — extend device life by generations
- **Open** — community-designed modules, published specs

**One standardized interconnect system across product categories.**

# Slide 5: Why Now

## Four forces converging

| Force                     | Status                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Regulation**            | EU Right to Repair mandatory by July 2026; 6 US states passed laws       |
| **Consumer demand**       | 80% willing to pay ~10% premium for sustainability                       |
| **Technical feasibility** | USB4/Thunderbolt 5 solved the bandwidth problem that killed Project Ara  |
| **Proven playbook**       | Framework ($45M raised), Fairphone (€87M), Back Market ($5.7B valuation) |

**The market is ready. The tech is ready. The regulation is coming.**

# Slide 6: Market Opportunity

## $1T+ consumer electronics market, zero modular options in most categories

| Segment                | Market Size            | Modular Players |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Laptops                | $166B                  | Framework ✓     |
| Smartphones            | $484B                  | Fairphone ✓     |
| **Kitchen appliances** | **$242B**              | **None**        |
| **Wearables**          | **$72B**               | **None**        |
| **Consumer audio**     | **$2.7B** (audiophile) | **None**        |
| **Smart home**         | **$154B**              | **None**        |

**We're starting where no one else is.**

# Slide 7: The Product — Starting with Audio

## Phase 1: The Technologic Player

A modular, high-fidelity digital audio player with retro soul.

**Why this beachhead:**

- Premium DAPs sell for **$800-$3,700** (Astell&Kern, FiiO)
- Audiophiles are early adopters who pay for quality
- No modular option exists
- Vinyl revival proves retro + quality = demand
- Small form factor = faster iteration

**Target: $399 base | $599 premium config**

# Slide 9: Business Model

## Hardware + Ecosystem + Services

| Revenue Stream       | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Device sales**     | Base units at healthy margins (target 40%+ gross) |
| **Module sales**     | Upgrades, replacements, specialty modules         |
| **Licensing**        | Open spec, certified third-party modules          |
| **Enterprise/Space** | NASA, ESA, private space companies (longer-term)  |

**LTV multiplier:** A customer who keeps upgrading modules for 10 years >> one-time device sale

## We're building infrastructure for a multi-planetary species

**Near-term:** Make electronics that last, that you can fix, that grow with you.

**Long-term:** Become the standard for modular electronics — on Earth, in orbit, on the Moon, on Mars.

> When humanity becomes a space-faring civilization, modularity won't be a nice-to-have.
> It will be how everything is built.

**We're starting now.**
